# **`Token Projects (Solidity)`**

This repository contains token projects written in Solidity.

It includes the IERC-20 standard contract and a custom implementation of it. 

The UI to interact with these contracts can be found at 

[`erc.adriannyc.dev`](https://erc.adriannyc.dev)

## `Interacting with the Contracts`

To create with contracts, you can use this command, and export my files to the contract folder using `thirdweb` framework

```bash
npx thirdweb@latest create
```

Alternatively, you can use Forge, or Ethereum REMIX to develop, deploy and interact with the contracts.
